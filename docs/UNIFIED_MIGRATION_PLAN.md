## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data Loss Risk**: Implement comprehensive backup strategy with point-in-time recovery
- **Performance Degradation**: Set up performance monitoring and alerting
- **WebSocket Integration**: Maintain Express WebSocket during Laravel migration
- **Authentication Issues**: Implement dual authentication during transition period
- **Database Consistency**: Use database transactions and validation checks

### Business Risks
- **User Experience Disruption**: Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- **Downtime Risk**: Use blue-green deployment strategy
- **Feature Parity**: Ensure all features work identically in new system
- **Team Training**: Provide Laravel training for development team

### Rollback Triggers
- **Performance degradation > 20%**
- **Authentication failures > 5%**
- **Data integrity issues**
- **Critical bugs in production**
- **User complaints > 10%**

## Rollback Strategy

### Immediate Rollback (0-2 hours)
1. **Switch feature flags** back to Express backend
2. **Revert DNS/load balancer** to Express endpoints
3. **Restore database** from backup if needed
4. **Notify users** of temporary service restoration

### Full Rollback (2-24 hours)
1. **Revert code changes** to previous stable version
2. **Restore database** to pre-migration state
3. **Restart Express services** with original configuration
4. **Validate all functionality** works as before
5. **Communicate with users** about rollback completion

### Post-Rollback Actions
1. **Analyze failure points** and document lessons learned
2. **Update migration plan** based on issues encountered
3. **Schedule retry** after addressing identified problems
4. **Update risk assessment** for future attempts
